Python Integration Suggestions:

-Data Analysis and Reporting:

    Use Python for generating reports or analytics on user behavior or event attendance. You could integrate libraries like Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib or Seaborn for data visualization. These reports could help the church understand which events are most popular or track the growth in sermon viewership over time.

-Automated Emails:

    Implement a system to send automated emails to the congregation. This could be for event reminders, newsletters, or personalized messages. Python’s smtplib can be used for sending emails, and you can store templates and recipient lists in PostgreSQL.

-Sermon Transcription:

    Integrate an automatic sermon transcription feature using Python speech recognition libraries, such as SpeechRecognition. You can automatically transcribe recorded sermons and make the text available on the website, which can be helpful for hearing-impaired members or those who prefer reading.

-Dynamic Content Generation:

    Create scripts that automatically update the website's content. For example, Python could be used to script the process of updating the front page with the latest sermon, event, or news item based on the most recent entries in the database.

-Integration with External APIs:

    Use Python to interface with external APIs for added functionalities. For example, integrate a weather API to display weather information on the day of an event, or use Google Maps API to provide directions to church events.

-Content Management System (CMS):

    Develop a simple backend CMS for the church website where administrators can easily post new content, update existing pages, and manage the gallery. Flask or Django can be great Python frameworks to handle web requests and manage content dynamically.

Others:

- For the church website I want to focus 100% on implementing all the ideas in the figma file and also in my notes.

  - Blog
  - Support/Donation Page.
  - Newsletter
  - Forum Page (church members can have discussion on past sermons or where the Pastor or other admin members can post things for the whole church can get, ie the stuff the pastor posts in WhatsApp)
  - Automations for posting things everywhere for the pastor like when he posts on the website it posts into the what’sapp group chat and maybe emails aswell . - Also implement automated Weekly event reminders or monthly reminders etc.
  - Update Events page
  - Sermon Transcriptions. (See README on VSCode)
  - Dynamic Content Generation.(See README on VSCode)
  - Update/Upgrade admin page to Content Management System(CMS). (See README on VSCode).

- I then want to optimise the website(ie. Implementing good practices, swapping out technologies for better optimised ones, optimise the site in general anywhere that can be done).
- I want to eventually then make the website into a mobile app using React Native.
