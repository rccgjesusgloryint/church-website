# Events Feature

This feature displays recurring activities that will be happening in the upcoming months, the purpose for this feature is to allow church members to come to this page and see the events that will be coming up that month, or in the months to come. Also for other users to see what happens in the church.

## Brain Dump:

- I want to have an upcoming and past events section
- The events page should be dynamic, so once an event has past in automically enters the past events section.
- Also the user should be able to click into the indiviual events to see more details about that specific event.
  - right now it goes to another page, but I feel that there isnt that much details stored to enter another page, so make this into modal for now.

## What to store

- Title
- Date of event
- Description
- Poster/Images
